                    Computer programming is my main focus now and days and I'm continuing to grow and expand my knowledge by building cool and exciting stuff every day. I started out as a self-taught developer learning HTML, CSS, and javascript when I graduated high school. To further push myself and jump in the water I took a 6-month developer Bootcamp course from UCF. After completing the course I felt like my programming ability had no limits towards the thing that I create. I love to learn new things and I'm very good a breaking thing, just as much as I am fixing them.
